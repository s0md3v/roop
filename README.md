# Roop

> Take a video and replace the face in it with a face of your choice. You only need one image of the desired face. No dataset, no training.

## Installation

Be aware, the installation needs technical skills and is not for beginners. Please do not open platform and installation related issues on GitHub.

[Basic](https://github.com/s0md3v/roop/wiki/1.-Installation) - It is more likely to work on your computer, but will be quite slow

[Acceleration](https://github.com/s0md3v/roop/wiki/2.-Acceleration) - Unleash the full potential of your CPU and GPU
